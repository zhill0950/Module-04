# 04 Web APIs: Personal Blog

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Github

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts.

At the landing page you will find multiple input fields where the user can add a title, username, and content. Upon submission, the user will be redirected to a blog page where their content will be rendered into a blog post. The user can utilize the "Back" button to return to the landing page in order to create more blog posts.

A light/dark theme toggle is in place so the user can opt between themes.

## Learning Points

This entire project was a learning experience. From utilizing existing CSS to preparing Javascript functions "from scratch." Below are some key points I had to overcome in order to make this website come to fruition.

1. Storing and gathering data from local storage
2. Appending elements to the page while still achieving the desired aesthetic
3. Using learned functions in combination with each other
4. Create HTML elements based off of an existing CSS styles sheet
5. Adding an event listener around my function so that the DOM content would load before running other code related to local storage

```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {...}
```

6. Learning about the forEach method to iterate through an array
