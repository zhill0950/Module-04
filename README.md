# 04 Web APIs: Personal Blog

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Github

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts.

At the landing page you will find multiple input fields where the user can add a title, username, and content. Upon submission, the user will be redirected to a blog page where their content will be rendered into a blog post. The user can utilize the "Back" button to return to the landing page in order to create more blog posts.

A light/dark theme toggle is in place so the user can opt between themes.

You can visit the deployed website by [clicking here](https://zhill0950.github.io/Module-04/).
